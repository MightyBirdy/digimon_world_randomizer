# Digimon World Randomizer
##### Digimon World 1 (PSX) data randomizer.  Create a unique, brand new experience for the classic game!

To use, open settings.ini and adjust all settings according to preference.  In `[general]`, set `Input` as the relative path to your Digimon World `.bin` file, then set `Output` to the filename where you would like the modified `.bin` file to be placed.

i.e. if your DW binary file is called `Digimon World.bin` and is in the same folder as `digimon_randomize.exe` or `digimon_randomize.py`:
`Input = Digimon World.bin`
`Output = Digimon World Rando.bin`

###### Note:  For most sections of the settings file, there is an `Enabled` field that must be set to yes before any of the other options will be used.
&nbsp;
After you have the settings you want, run `digimon_randomize.py` or `digimon_randomize.exe`.  The random seed will be printed out to the console. If you did not manually set a seed via `Seed`, one will be randomly generated.
See race instructions below for creating identical race ROMs.

##### Steps for first time setup:
1. Download the latest release of `digimon_randomizer.zip`
2. Unzip to wherever
3. Open `settings.ini` and fill out the file paths for `Input` and `Output`
    * Paths can be absolute or relative, and should point to the `.bin` file
4. Change the other settings to your liking
5. Run `digimon_randomize.exe`
6. Load the `.bin` file at the `Output` location into your emulator of choice

##### Recommended race setup:
1. Follow 1-4 above
2. Set `LogLevel` to `race`
3. Set the seed to any number, or simply run the randomizer and copy the random seed produced
4. Once `Seed` in `settings.ini` is set to the value you want, send your `settings.ini` file to your race opponents
5. All race participants should update `Input`/`Output` in `settings.ini` to their own paths
6. All race participants should run `digimon_randomize.exe`
7. If everyone's settings matched, including the seed, an identical ROM will be produced for everyone.


### Version log:

    - random mode for tech data -- instead of just shuffling the existing values, generates true
                                   random values.  Power ranges from 30% below vanilla lowest to
                                   30% above vanilla highest (cap 999).  MP cost ranges from 10%
                                   to 140% of power value.  This means less complete garbage
                                   moves while still having the occasional amazing move.

###### Bug Fixes
    - Toy Town can now properly be opened by the digimon the suit evolves to (when special
